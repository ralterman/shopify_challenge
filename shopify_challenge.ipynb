    "### As we can see, the average order value seems to be significantly higher than what we would think by looking at the data and just from domain knowledge of sneaker prices in general. From the summary of order amounts, we see that 75% of the order amounts fall at or below \\$390. By taking a look at a histogram of the order amounts, we can see that there are a few major outliers skewing the data. Because outliers can play a big role in affecting the mean of our data, it is a better idea to use the <font color='red'>median</font> as a metric as it is less prone to outliers. In this case, the median order amount is <font color='red'>$284</font>. Check out my blog on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/when-the-median-is-favorable-to-the-mean-c5b01b149ec0?source=friends_link&sk=e10db18b21d47563f06d446dcb1e00ac) about when the median is favorable to the mean as a descriptive statistic / measure of central tendency."
